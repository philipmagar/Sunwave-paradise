# Sunwave Paradise

So, here's the deal with this project. I didn't want to build just another "cool" looking template that breaks the moment you try to actually use it. I wanted something that felt like a real business, specifically tailored for the hospitality scene in Kathmandu where Sunwave Paradise is based. It is not true booking website, it is just a mockup of a booking website. There exist no such place as sunwaveparadise my imagination  only .

### The Vision
The goal was simple: make it look expensive (because luxury sells) but keep the booking process dead simple. Most local customers in Nepal don't want to navigate a 10-step checkout; they want to see the room, see the price, and hit someone up on WhatsApp. That's why the WhatsApp button is basically the heart of the site.

### Decisions I Made
**Clean Components**: The room data is centralized. If Sunwave Paradise adds a new penthouse tomorrow, you update one JSON file and the whole site (Home, Rooms, Detail) updates. No hardcoding $50 prices everywhere.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone it.
2.  `npm install` (I used `--legacy-peer-deps` because React 19 is still new to some older helmet packages).
3.  `npm run dev`

Go build something awesome.
